# Predicting Bike Sharing Demand

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing machine learning models to predict bike rental demand based on various temporal and environmental factors. The goal is to accurately forecast the number of bike rentals at any given time, considering variables such as weather conditions, time of day, and day of the week.

## Models Implemented
Three different machine learning models were developed and compared for this project:

• Linear Regression: A baseline model to understand the linear relationships between features and bike rental demand.

• Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

• Gradient Boosting: An advanced technique that builds trees sequentially, with each tree correcting the errors of the previous ones.

## Key Features
• Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

• Feature Engineering: Created new features and transformed existing ones to improve model performance.

• Model Training and Evaluation: Trained multiple models and evaluated their performance using appropriate metrics.

• Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized model parameters to achieve the best possible predictions.

• Comparative Analysis: Compared the performance of different models to identify the most effective approach.

## Technologies Used
• Python

• Pandas for data manipulation

• Scikit-learn for model implementation

• Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
